// The worker pool (§T511 persistence + §V22 latency redesign). Structure:
//
//   - poolChs[w] is worker w's MAILBOX: a small buffered channel used ONLY
//     with non-blocking sends and receives. Tasks therefore always sit in the
//     channel BUFFER — never in a recvq direct handoff — so any hot worker,
//     or the caller itself, can steal a chunk whose designated worker is slow
//     to arrive. One single-consumer-ish mailbox per worker instead of one
//     shared channel: with a shared channel every submission made all spinning
//     workers stampede onto the channel's internal runtime mutex, whose
//     contention backoff is usleep — measured 40% usleep + 22% lock2 of a
//     decode profile, ~70µs per barrier even with every worker hot.
//
//   - poolPark[w] is worker w's park signal. A worker that runs out of spin
//     budget blocks HERE, never on its mailbox, so a task destined for a
//     parked worker stays stealable and the thread-wake latency stays OFF the
//     barrier's critical path: the caller signals poolPark after filling the
//     mailbox, keeps computing, and if the worker is slow to wake the chunk is
//     simply drained by a sibling or the caller. Wakes still cost the sender a
//     goready (~µs) but no longer serialize the barrier.
//
//   - Spin-before-park (dense regime only, see poolDense): a parked thread
//     costs a full OS wake to restart (measured ~100µs of pthread_cond_signal/
//     _wait per barrier on an M2 Pro — 71% of the whole
//     BenchmarkLlamaGenerate500RowBuf profile), which dwarfs the µs-scale
//     chunks a single-token decode dispatches. In the dense regime each worker
//     polls for poolSpinPolls empty receives (~200µs) before parking — enough
//     to bridge the serial glue between decode barriers (norm/rope/sampling,
//     ≲25µs each, plus per-token sampling) so back-to-back barriers run
//     signal-free after the first. The spin must NOT yield: a Gosched variant
//     melted down on sched.lock (12 spinners × ~1M yields/s → lock2+usleep
//     >50% of the profile). Yield-free is safe: the pool holds GOMAXPROCS-1
//     workers, the caller works its own chunk, so spinners never outnumber
//     free Ps, and the poll is a function call so async preemption (GC, STW)
//     works normally. In the sparse regime workers park immediately on the
//     mailbox itself (recvq handoff — the old pool's exact wake path).
//
//   - Submission is NON-blocking everywhere: when a mailbox is full (nested
//     parallelWork from inside a worker, or GOMAXPROCS grew after init) the
//     chunk runs inline on the caller, so the pool can never deadlock.
//
// Constants are not user knobs (internal, §C13-exempt); recalibrate via §V22
// benchmarks if the pool design changes.

// Dense-regime detection: the aggressive latency machinery (worker spin,
// stealing, caller help, width cap) is only worth its side effects for

// glue. Everywhere else it is actively harmful, and not only as burn:
// always-spin variants measured +10-40% on warm mid-size ops and +25% on a
// 256³ gemm (continuously-burning worker threads lose their macOS scheduler
// standing — priority decay, E-core placement, no wake boost — and every
// barrier then waits on a badly-placed straggler), and sparse-mode stealing
// measured +30-50% on 11-way elementwise barriers (eleven waking workers
// sweeping each other's mailboxes serialize on the channel mutexes and
// migrate tasks away from their wakers). So an op runs in dense mode only if
//
//	its total work is decode-sized (< poolDenseMaxWork — a [1,dim]·[dim,vocab]
//	head gemv at this model scale is ~256k units, warm mid-size throughput

//	the serial glue since the previous barrier ENDED is short
//	(< poolDenseGapNs — decode's norm/rope/sampling glue is ≲25µs, while a

//	glue rather than start→start cadence keeps the verdict independent of
//	how fast the barriers themselves run (a start→start rule locked decode
//	into sparse mode: sparse barriers are slow, so the gap never shrank).
//
// Sparse mode is exactly the old pool's discipline: full width, park on
